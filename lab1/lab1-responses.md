1. I wrote console.log("Hello World!") in the console
2. I see "Hello World!" outputted in the console. (I am now a CS god)
3. I typed in console.log(x = 2) and it outputted 2.
4. I typed in console.log(x + 378) and it outputted 380.
5. I set y = "stitch" and when I ran console.log(x+y); it outputted 2stitch so it basically just concatenated them.
6. y.includes("hello") outputted false because my string y doesn't have "hello" within it. y.repeat(10) just repeated the string y 10 times.
7. square(5) returned 25, square(2.5) returned 6.25 (meaning the * operator isn't strictly for ints but doubles as well), and square("hello") returned NaN standing for not a number (meaning the * operator isn't defined for strings). The function square still works if you change i to x as long as you change each instance.
8. With this new definition of square, square("hello") returns -1 as expected.
9. For my definition of numberString, numberString(10) returns "12345678910" and numberString("h") and numberString(-3) return "input a positive number pls".
